## About:
In this project we will train a neural network to classify the points in the dataset.  
We will give the network the points and the value of the points and the network will predict the value of the points (the value will be explained later).  
We will use the Back-Propagation Algorithm to train the network.

Training a Neural Network to classify 2D points to the nearest neuron (cluster) by Using Kohonen-Algorithm of Self Organizing Map (SOM).
